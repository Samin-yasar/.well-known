# Domain Verification for Bluesky (ATProto DID)

## Overview

This repository was created to facilitate domain verification for my personal Bluesky account via the AT Protocol (ATProto).

By hosting a verification file at the following URL: [https://samin-yasar.github.io/.well-known/atproto-did]


I was able to successfully verify ownership of the domain `samin-yasar.github.io` with Bluesky.

## Technical Details

- The `.well-known/atproto-did` file contains the DID (Decentralized Identifier) required by the AT Protocol for domain-based identity verification.
- This is part of Bluesky's decentralized identity system, allowing users to associate their domain name with their Bluesky account.

## Repository Status

The verification process has been completed successfully. This repository is now being archived and preserved solely for historical and reference purposes. No further development or updates are expected.
